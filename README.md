# SENG 3130 - Final Report - Volunteer Management System

## Vision and Scope Document
 
### 1. Business Requirements
#### 1.1. Background
During the covid pandemic, there was a decline in the use of volunteer aids in the client's community. This is due partially to the fact that there were a lot of customers lost, as well as a huge drop off of volunteers during the pandemic. On top of all this, the onboarding system that we currently have is taking too long with wait times upwards of two weeks to complete a background check through the police.

#### 1.2. Business Opportunity
For this volunteer management system, the business opportunities that can come out of this project is that more city activities will have more volunteers, which can boost the city’s popularity. It can help boost the number of volunteers being involved with the city, performing tasks that can benefit the stakeholders. Currently, the limitations of the previous management system is that it takes longer than usual to get volunteer requests. This makes it less likely that volunteers will take on the request. Taking longer to post new requests, will cause a shortage in volunteers due to the late posting time. This new volunteer management system will help reduce the possibility of the volunteer shortage to two times per year. It will also be able to predict and deduce if there will not be enough volunteers by notifying management if cases don’t have volunteers by a one-week notice.

#### 1.3. Business Objectives and Success Criteria
The volunteer management system's business objective is to create a system that is easily accessible to all the stakeholders, such as clients, volunteers, and clients with different tasks and needs. This system will help speed up the process of getting more volunteer requests, which will make volunteer assignments quicker and reduce the possibility of volunteer shortages. Volunteers can check to see if there are openings through the system rather than going in person. The volunteer management system should be able to track 60% of senior cases and support up to 85% of cases. It should be able to handle approximately 6000 to 9000 cases with a low bound of 5100 and an upper bound of 7650 cases. The system should also help reduce the last-minute volunteer shortages to two times per year by getting volunteer support within three days.
